I am a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Washington, advised by Prof. [Yin Tat Lee](https://yintat.com/).
I recieved B.S in Mathematics and Physics from Tsinghua University in 2020.

Currently, I am primarily focused on research in the field of theoretical computer science, with a particular emphasis on Differential Privacy, Stochastic Optimization, and Algorithm Design.
